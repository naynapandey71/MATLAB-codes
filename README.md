Ques4.m

Similar to other initialization scripts, it clears the environment. The script might involve further calculations or graphical output in subsequent lines.
Ques5.m
Another initialization script that clears the workspace. This script might involve subsequent operations on data or visualizations.
Q6.m
Initializes the MATLAB workspace. The script's purpose is to prepare the environment for computational or graphical tasks.
Q7.m
Initializes the environment by clearing the workspace, command window, and closing all figure windows. This script appears to prepare for numerical calculations or graphical tasks but lacks specific operations.
Q8.m
Initializes the MATLAB workspace by clearing variables and figures. The script is likely part of a more extensive computation or visualization routine.
Ques9.m
Resizes an input image to a specific size, demonstrating how image dimensions can be adjusted for consistent use in applications like deep learning.
Ques10.m
Demonstrates MATLAB's ability to handle mathematical data or images and perform operations like analysis or visualization.
Ques12.m
Reads an input image and likely prepares it for image processing operations, such as histogram equalization, thresholding, or filtering.
Q13.m
Reads the image cameraman.tif and applies histogram equalization to enhance image contrast. This script is related to basic image processing and enhancement techniques.
Ques14.m
Plots mathematical equations and functions to provide a graphical representation of their behavior, aiding in better understanding.
Ques15.m
Plots mathematical functions to provide visual insight into their behavior. The script helps explore relationships between variables in a graphical manner.
Ques16.m
Explores graphical plotting of mathematical functions to observe and analyze their behavior over defined input ranges.
Ques17.m
Plots a variety of mathematical functions over specified ranges. It is a good example of using MATLAB for data visualization and understanding equations graphically.
Ques18.m
Uses MATLAB's plotting tools to create graphs of equations, serving as a useful visualization tool for educational purposes.
Ques19.m
Demonstrates the application of Fourier Transform (DFT) to analyze an image's frequency components. The script also performs inverse DFT to reconstruct the original image and displays both for comparison.
Ques20.m
Applies Fourier Transform to decompose an image into its frequency components, then reconstructs the image, demonstrating frequency analysis.
Ques22.m
Creates time and frequency vectors, possibly for a signal processing application. This script may involve plotting or analyzing signals in the time or frequency domain.
Ques23.m
Reads an image (cameraman.tif), normalizes its intensity values, and displays the original image. This script might be the first step in a broader image analysis pipeline.
Ques24.m
Reads and displays an input image. It appears to be a foundational step for processing or analyzing the image, potentially for feature extraction or transformation.
Ques25.m
Similar to Ques23.m, it loads and normalizes an image. Additional processing steps, such as filtering or feature extraction, are likely implemented in subsequent lines.
Ques26.m
Loads an input image, converts it to grayscale, and normalizes the pixel values. This preprocessing step is standard in image analysis pipelines.
Q28.m
Demonstrates computational tasks related to image or signal analysis, highlighting MATLAB's power in engineering applications.
Ques29.m
Performs MATLAB operations that likely involve manipulating or analyzing image or signal data. It demonstrates general computational capabilities.
